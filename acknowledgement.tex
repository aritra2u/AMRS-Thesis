Since no one walks alone on the journey of life and no work can be accomplished without the contributions from various people around, where do you start to thank those that joined you, walked beside you, and helped you along the way and now when I stand at this stage of completion of my thesis work, I would like take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude towards each and every one of them.

I would like to express my sincere gratitude towards my thesis supervisor, Dr. Arnab Bhattacharya, for his  constant support and encouragement. I am grateful for his patient guidance and advice in giving a proper direction to my efforts. I thank the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Kanpur, for providing the necessary infrastructure and a congenial environment for research work.

A big thank you to all my department friends and my wing mates for making my last year of stay in campus a fun one. Last, but not the least, I thank my parents for always being there for me.

Music enthusiasts often prefer to listen to music as per their current mood. Also, a song's popularity plays an important role as a user might be interested in listening to a popular and trending song which might not get along with her musical taste or mood.

The proposed system tries to profile its users' musical tastes by paying attention to what they listen on their devices and is scrobbled by Last.FM. The mood of a user is profiled as well by analysing the recent few songs heard. Recommendations are made based on what other users with similar musical taste have heard right after when they had a similar musical mood in their history.  Recommendations are made taking into account the song popularity as well as the user's current mood giving them appropriate weightages over each other.
